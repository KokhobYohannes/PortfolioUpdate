# PortfolioUpdate
Description: Having gone over Bootstrap and its components during class, we were assigned homework to create our own website to put our knowledge to the test. For this week's homework, I created a three page website contaning information about myself on the 'Homepage', a 'Portfolio' page showcasing images and titles some of the languages learned and finally a 'Contact Me' page where users can enter their information for me to later reach out to them.

Please note that the contact page is non-functional at this point. Meaning that although information can be entered, it will not be shared/submitted. On each of the pages, there are recurring elements such as the navbar, social media links and a footer.The theme and colors are kept consistent on each page.


Goal: To create a responsive three page website using Bootstrap with a navbar and functional links.
